  "Tests based on detecting cycles between operations in a history.

  First, we define a bunch of ways you can compute a dependency graph over a
  history. Our graphs use completions (e.g. ok, info) for the canonical
  representation of an operation. For instance:

  `realtime-graph` relates a->b if operation b begins after operation a
  completes successfully.

  `process-graph` relates a->b if a and b are performed by the same process,
  and that process executes a before b.

  `monotonic-key-graph` assumes op :values are maps of keys to observed values,
  like {:x 1 :y 2}. It relates a->b if b observed a higher value of some key
  than a did. For instance, {:x 1 :y 2} -> {:x 2 :y 2}, because :x is higher in
  the second op.

  `wr-graph` assumes op :values are transactions like [[f k v] ...], and
  relates operations based on transactional reads and writes: a->b if b
  observes a value that a wrote. This order requires that keys only have a
  given value written once.

  You can also *combine* graphs using `combine`, which takes the union of
  multiple graphs. `(combine realtime monotonic-key)`, for instance, verifies
  that not only must the values of each key monotonically increase, but that
  those increases must be observed in real time: stale reads are not allowed.

  Given a function which takes a history and produces a dependency graph, the
  checker runs that function, identifies strongly-connected components in the
  resulting graph, and decides whether the history is valid based on whether
  the graph has any strongly connected components--e.g. cycles."

; This is going to look a bit odd. Please bear with me.
;
; Our analysis generally goes like this:
;
;   1. Take a history, and analyze it to build a dependency graph.
;   2. Find cycles in that graph
;   3. Explain why those are cycles
;
; Computing the graphs is fairly straightforward, but explaining cycles is a
; bit less so, because the explanation may require data that's expensive to
; calculate. For instance, realtime orders would like to be able to tell you
; when precisely a given ok operation was invoked, and that needs an expensive
; index to be constructed over the full history. We want to be able to *re-use*
; that expensive state.
;
; At the top level, we want to have a single object that defines how to analyze
; a history *and* how to explain why the results of that analysis form cycles.
; We also want to be able to *compose* those objects together. That means that
; both graph construction and cycle explanation must compose.
;
; To do this, we decouple analysis into three objects:
;
; - An Analyzer, which which examines a history and produces a pair of:
; - A Graph of dependencies over completion ops, and
; - An Explainer, which can explain cycles between those ops.
;
; We write our Analyzers as a function (f history) => [graph explainer]. Graphs
; are Bifurcan DirectedGraphs. Explainers have a protocol, because we're going
; to pack some cached state into them.

(defn appends-and-reads-graph
  "Some parts of a transaction's dependency graph--for instance,
  anti-dependency cycles--involve the *version order* of states for a key.
  Given two transactions: [[:w :x 1]] and [[:w :x 2]], we can't tell whether T1
  or T2 happened first. This makes it hard to identify read-write and
  write-write edges, because we can't tell what particular transaction should
  have overwritten the state observed by a previous transaction.

  However, if we constrain ourselves to transactions whose only mutation is to
  *append* a value to a key's current state...

    {:f :txn, :value [[:r :x [1 2]] [:append :x 3] [:r :x [1 2 3]]]} ...

  ... we can derive the version order for (almost) any pair of operations on
  the same key because the order of appends is encoded in every read: if we
  observe [:r :x [3 1 2]], we know the previous states must have been [3] [3 1]
  [3 1 2].

  That is, assuming appends actually work correctly. If the database loses
  appends or reorders them, it's *likely* (but not necessarily the case), that
  we'll observe states like:

    [1 2 3]
    [1 3 4]  ; 2 has been lost!

  We can verify these in a single O(appends^2) pass by sorting all observed
  states for a key by size, and verifying that each is a prefix of the next.
  Assuming we *do* observe a total order, we can use the longest read value for
  each key as an order over appends for that key. This order is *almost*
  complete in that appends which are never read can't be related, but so long
  as the DB lets us see most of our appends at least once, this should work.

  So then, our strategy here is to compute those orders for each key, then use
  them to relate successive [w w], [r w], and [w r] pair on that key. [w,w]
  pairs are a direct write dependency, [w,r] pairs are a direct
  read-dependency, and [r,w] pairs are direct anti-dependencies.

  Definitions', page 8."
